## Quarto

Quarto is a powerful **typesetting tool**. Instead of writing the report or presentation in Word, PowerPoint, or a Google Doc; running code in an R script; saving output and visualizations; and pasting them in the report or the presentation -- we can do it all in Quarto.

- [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html): Simple typesetting syntax.
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/): Allows us to include code cells (in R, Python, SQL, etc.) and output as part of the document.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org): Magic that outputs the Quarto document as nearly anything.

## YAML

The header at the top of a Quarto document coded in **YAML** (i.e., Yet Another Markup Language).

```

author: "Marc Dotson"
format: docx

```

While Quarto can produce HTML documents, PowerPoint slides, slides (like these), [GitHub documents](https://github.com/marcdotson/ra-training), [blogs](https://www.occasionaldivergences.com), webpages, etc. -- unless specified otherwise, **all subsequent assignments will be submitted as Word documents rendered from a Quarto document**.

## Quarto Basics

- Use `##` headings and `###` sub-headings to clearly identify sections.
- Code cells begin with `‘‘‘{r}` and end with `‘‘‘` and should include *comments* but not *text*.
- Use a separate code cell for every question so that output and text can be provided *in-line*.
- Produce bullet points using -s.
- Identify `functions` and `data` with `s, *italics* with *s, and **bold** with **s.
- Quarto also has a visual editor.
- There are options, including running all previous code or a single code cell.
- Pay attention to required white space.
- Render the document to produce the specified output.
- **Always read the output.**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---

```{r eval=FALSE}
crm_data <- read_csv("customer_data.csv") |> 
  left_join(read_csv("store_transactions.csv"), join_by(customer_id))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
crm_data <- read_csv(here::here("Data", "customer_data.csv")) |> 
  left_join(read_csv(here::here("Data", "store_transactions.csv")), join_by(customer_id))
```

## Data Structure and Summarizing

How can we summarize the transactions for 2018 by region?

```{r}
crm_data |> 
  select(region, customer_id, contains("2018"))
```

## Tidy Data

**Tidy data** is defined as follows:

- Each observation has its own row.
- Each variable has its own column.
- Each value has its own cell.

This may seem obvious or simple, but this common philosophy is at the heart of the *tidy*verse. It also means we will often prefer **longer** datasets to **wider** datasets and {tidyr} will help us move between the two.

---

## Pivot Longer

The most common identifying feature of **messy data** is when column names are really values.

```{r}
crm_data |> 
  select(region, customer_id, contains("2018"))
```

---

When column names are really values, the data frame ends up being wider than it should be. Use `pivot_longer()` to pivot the data frame longer by **turning column names into values**.

```{r}
crm_long <- crm_data |>
  select(region, customer_id, contains("2018")) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    -c(region, customer_id),
    names_to = "month_year",
    values_to = "transactions"
  )
```

---

Note how much *longer* the data frame is and *why*.

```{r}
crm_long
```

---

Now summarizing the transactions for 2018 by region is trivial.

```{r}
crm_long |> 
  group_by(region) |> 
  summarize(
    total_transactions = sum(transactions),
    avg_transactions = mean(transactions)
  )
```

## Pivot Wider

If the data has the opposite problem and has values that should really be column names, use `pivot_wider()` to pivot the data frame wider by **turning values into column names**.

```{r}
crm_long |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = month_year,
    values_from = transactions
  )
```

---

<center>
![](../../Figures/pivot.gif){width=500px}
</center>

## Separate Columns

If two (or more) values are in one column, `separate()` the values into two (or more) columns.

```{r}
crm_long
```

---

```{r}
crm_long <- crm_long |>
  separate(month_year, c("month", "year"), sep = "_")

crm_long
```

---

Now we can summarize the transactions for 2018 by month *and* region.

```{r}
crm_long |> 
  group_by(month, region) |> 
  summarize(
    total_transactions = sum(transactions),
    avg_transactions = mean(transactions)
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_transactions))
```

## Unite Columns

When two (or more) values should be in one column, `unite()` the values into one column.

```{r}
crm_long |>
  unite("month_year", c(month, year), sep = "_")
```

---

Of all the {tidyr} functions, `unite()` might seem the least useful. However, we really would like `month_year` to be an actual date. If we can add a day, we can use {lubridate} to create a date.

```{r}
crm_long <- crm_long |>
  mutate(day = 1) |> 
  unite("date", c(day, month, year), sep = "-") |> 
  mutate(date = dmy(date))

crm_long
```

---

With a long data frame and a `date` column, we can plot a time series of transactions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
crm_long |> 
  group_by(date, region) |> 
  summarize(
    total_transactions = sum(transactions),
    avg_transactions = mean(transactions)
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = avg_transactions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "month", date_labels = "%b")
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
crm_long |> 
  group_by(date, region) |> 
  summarize(
    total_transactions = sum(transactions),
    avg_transactions = mean(transactions)
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = avg_transactions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "month", date_labels = "%b")
```

## Data Classes and Types

We've been using **data frames** (technically **tibbles**, a modern data frame). A data frame is composed of columns called **vectors**. Both data frames and vectors are classes of data.

Each vector has a *single* data type. We've discussed **double** (i.e., numeric), **integer**, **date**, **character**, and **factor**. If we try to mix data types in a vector, it will pick the easiest one to satisfy.

```{r}
vector_example <- c(1, 2, "three")

vector_example
```

---

Data frames are nice to work with because each vector can be of a different data type.

```{r}
tibble(id = 1:3, state = "AZ")
```

## Coercion

Sometimes we need to **coerce** a data class or type.

```{r}
as_tibble(vector_example)
```

Why would we want to coerce a data class?

---

We can similarly coerce data types with `as.*()` functions (e.g., `as.numeric()` and `as.character()`).

Coercing dates can be tricky.

We often want to coerce factors using the `fct_*()` functions.

Why would we want to coerce a data type, especially factors?

---

```{r}
crm_data |> 
  mutate(region = fct_infreq(region)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = region)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

Note that `geom_bar()` is a wrapper for both `count()` and `geom_col()` (i.e., only a single variable is needed and the count is performed as part of the plot).

We've already used `fct_reorder()` to coerce a factor ordered by another variable. Now we've used `fct_infreq()` to coerce a factor ordered by frequency and, if you like, `fct_rev()` to reverse that order.

---

```{r}
crm_data |> 
  mutate(region = region |> fct_infreq() |> fct_rev()) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = region)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Exercise 5

Customers are often analyzed based on those who have made recent purchases, frequent purchases, and spent the most. This is known as a recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) analysis. Now that we can tidy data, we can analyze customers based on recent purchases and frequent purchases. As you work, *remember to sketch out what you'd like the data to look like.* In RStudio on Posit Cloud, create a new Quarto document and do the following.

1. Let's define customers who have made recent purchases as anyone who has made more than 10 transactions in 2018. Report on the composition of these customers.
2. Let's define customers who have made frequent purchases as anyone who has made more than 150 transactions total. Report on the composition of these customers.
3. Render the Quarto document into Word, export the Word document, and upload to Canvas.
